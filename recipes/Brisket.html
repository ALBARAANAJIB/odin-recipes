          <h3>Steps(make sure to follow carefully)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the desired temperature, typically around 300°F (150°C).</li>
            <li>Prepare the brisket by trimming excess fat, then pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together your aromatic spices, salt, and any additional seasonings you desire.</li>
            <li>Rub the spice mixture generously all over the brisket, ensuring even coverage.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Sear the brisket on all sides until nicely browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove the brisket from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, deglaze with beef broth or stock, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Stir in Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, and apple cider vinegar to create a flavorful sauce.</li>
            <li>Return the brisket to the skillet, nestling it into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover the skillet or roasting pan with foil or a lid.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for several hours, or until the brisket is fork-tender.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the brisket from the oven and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve the sliced brisket with the delicious pan sauce drizzled over the top.</li>
          </ol>
